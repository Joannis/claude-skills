# Swift Server Skills & Linting

A collection of Claude skills for guidance on Swift (Server) development, along with a linting tool that enforces best practices.

## The Technique

Claude, as any LLM (or Human) makes mistakes. When Claude makes a mistake, most people have one of two reactions:
- Tell Claude it sucks, and let it try again.
- Open up some social media, and vent about how Claude sucks.

However, trying the same with Humans has proven extremely ineffective. *Humans bite back.*

### The solution

The solution is a pretty simple feedback loop:
1. Whenever you generate code, _read it_ before you commit.
2. If you see a mistake, try to articulate what should be improved and _why_.
3. Iterate 2. until you have a rationale Claude can follow easily.
4. Add the rationale with a small code sample to a Claude skill, to ensure future iterations have the same context.

And now the critical step: **Encode your newfound rule/skill as a linter rule.**

This last step ensures that future code generated by Claude will follow these same rules, independently of whether the skill is in the LLM's context window.

## Overview

This repository contains two main components:

1. **Skills** - Knowledge bases that provide expert guidance on Swift server topics
2. **swift-server-lint** - A linting tool that enforces best practices from the skills
